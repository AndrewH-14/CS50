My project that I created for the CS 50 final project is a Movie List/Rank program. This program is a
command line C program which implements the list using a double linked list. Not only can my program
add and remove information from the list in real time, I also implemented a system where information
can be saved. To accomplish this the program prints all information in the list into a text file before the
program is exited. Then the next time the program is run it will read in all the information from the file
and create a linked list from it. When the program is run, it first takes you to a Program menu. This
menu directs you to either go to the name menu, go to the movie menu, or quit the program. The name
menu contains options to either add a name, remove a name, or list all the names in the list. The movie
menu contains a variety of options for the movie list of the user, including listing all moves or only the
top few movies.
